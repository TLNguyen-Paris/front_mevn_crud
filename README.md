# Frontend CRUD MEVN Stack

This is the frontend of my CRUD project, check out the back on this [link](https://github.com/TLNguyen-Paris/back_mevn_crud). For any question you can add me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanh-nguyen-paris/)

This project was created in order to learn how to split frontend and backend and communicate between them using MEVN stack (Mongo, Express, Vue3, Node).

Depedencies used : axios, vue, vue-router, dotenv, bootstrap

I'm not a fan of bootstrap but i've used it because it gives simple styling. I'm more fond of developing features and learn how code works than styling .


## How to install ? 

You can clone it or fork it but the code will not work fully because of the environment variable. You will need to add the backend url.

```
npm install && npm run serve
```

This project is deployed on heroku (it can takes few second to render) on this [link](https://vue-crud-thanh.herokuapp.com/) or [https://vue-crud-thanh.herokuapp.com/](https://vue-crud-thanh.herokuapp.com/)
